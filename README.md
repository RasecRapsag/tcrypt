# TCrypt - Interface for handling Truecrypt

TCrypt is a tool written in Python to manage Truecrypt files, using a Docker container to manage encrypted volumes.

## Motivation

Most Linux distributions are dropping support for older libraries used by Truecrypt, even Arch Linux will no longer have an AUR repository with the option to install Truecrypt. So, I intend to keep access to my volumes encrypted using this tool along with a Docker image built specifically for this purpose.
